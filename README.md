# Fall 2022 Vue Content

We will use this repo and a set of branches for the first steps of learning VueJS and the basics of javascript frameworks.

## Branches

- main branch:
  - Most boiler plate code removed
  - Tailwind Added
- utils branch:
  - prettier and eslint configured for a minimally intrusive but helpful workflow
- develop branch:
  - based on utils, where we will work on code in class

## Purpose of this Repo

- To store our in class examples
- To provide a place to explore and experiment

## Notes

Keep in mind that in this repo we are using [Vue](https://vuejs.org). Later we will switch to [NuxtJS](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) which is built around Vue. Nuxt automates a lot of things that we do manually in Vue.

Remember to check the [Vue Docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) when you run into difficulties.
